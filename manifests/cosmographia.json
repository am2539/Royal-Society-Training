Apian's work was edited and corrected by his student Gemma Frisius soon after its initial publication; Frisius' edition was first published in 1529. Both Apian and Frisius were interested in instruments: Apian published many manuals relating to them, including his vernacular <i>Instrument Buch</i> (1533), and Frisius is noted as an instrument-maker. <i>Cosmographia</i> made frequent reference to instruments and so it is appropriate that this title-page focuses on them. The figure shows, in miniature, a pocket dial (perhaps also incorporating a compass), a quadrant and a pillar dial.

All together, the image stakes a claim for cosmography as a discipline that depends on instrumental measurement.</p>"
